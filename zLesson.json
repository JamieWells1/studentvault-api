      "explanation": "Nuclear fission refers specifically to the splitting of an atomic nucleus into smaller parts, in contrast to fusion, which is the combining of nuclei."
    },
    {
      "text": "During fission, a heavy nucleus like Uranium-235 absorbs a neutron and becomes unstable. This instability leads to the nucleus splitting into two smaller nuclei, known as fission fragments, along with the release of additional neutrons and a significant amount of energy."
    },
    {
      "fill_in_the_blank": "Fission occurs when a heavy nucleus like [Uranium-235/Uranium-238] absorbs a [neutron/proton] and splits into smaller nuclei."
    },
    {
      "text": "The process of fission not only releases a large amount of energy but also produces more neutrons. These neutrons can then induce further fission events in nearby nuclei, creating a chain reaction, which is fundamental for the functioning of nuclear reactors."

      "question": "What is a chain reaction in nuclear fission?",
      "wrong_answers": [
        "A smooth transition of protons",
        "The process of nucleus fusion",
        "A radioactive decay process"
      ],
      "correct_answers": ["An ongoing series of fission events"],
      "explanation": "A chain reaction occurs when the neutrons produced from one fission event induce further fission in more nuclei, leading to a self-sustaining series of reactions."

      "text": "Understanding fission's principles and chain reactions is crucial for harnessing nuclear energy efficiently and safely. This knowledge has applications in powering nuclear reactors as well as in technologies related to nuclear weapons."

      "wrong_answers": ["Solar energy", "Chemical synthesis", "Wind power"],

      "explanation": "Nuclear fission is widely used in nuclear reactors where the energy released from fission reactions is converted into electrical energy."

    {
      "text": "In summary, nuclear fission plays a vital role in both energy production and nuclear weaponry. It involves the splitting of heavy nuclei, the spontaneous release of energy, and the generation of neutrons that perpetuate further fission events."
